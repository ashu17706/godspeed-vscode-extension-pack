2. YAML validation for `events` `workflow`

## Dependencies
`Godspped Extension Pack` is dependend on [Prisma](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) and [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) VSCode extensions.

1. Prisma
> Godspeed framework internally utilizes [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) to make working with databases easy.

2. YAML
> `events`, `workflows` and `datasources` in Godspeed framework are primararly written in `YAML`. So this extension provides a configurable [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). Godspeed framework utilizes that to provide hover on code, code completion, static code analysis and many more features for better developer experience.
